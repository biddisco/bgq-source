We include three example programs that use SPI calls to program 
the BG/Q network and the BG/Q messaging unit. 

1) Alltoall test: shows how to program via remote put operations. It 
also shows the different zone routing modes.

2) Collective test: demonstrates allreduce int sum and fp64 sum operations
via remote puts and memory FIFO messages.

3) Point-to-point ping pong : a memory fifo test where two nodes ping 
pong a message.

These tests only work with one process per node and may need at least 32 nodes
to run. Notice at 32 nodes, typically we get a full 5D torus. The tests can 
be easily altered for other configurations.

Copy the /bgsys/drivers/ppcfloor/spi/examples/mu directory to your own
directory.  In that directory, run make to build the examples.
