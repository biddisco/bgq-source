/*!
 * \brief __INLINE__ definition
 * 
 * Option 1:
 * Make all functions be "static inline":
 * - They are inlined if the compiler can do it
 * - If the compiler does not inline it, a single copy of the function is
 *   placed in the translation unit (eg. xxx.c)for use within that unit.
 *   The function is not externalized for use by another unit...we want this
 *   so we don't end up with multiple units exporting the same function,
 *   which would result in linker errors.
 *
 * Option 2:
 * A GNU C model: Use "extern inline" in a common header (this one) and provide
 * a definition in a .c file somewhere, perhaps using macros to ensure that the
 * same code is used in each case. For instance, in the header file:
 *
 * \verbatim
   #ifndef INLINE
   # define INLINE extern inline
   #endif
   INLINE int max(int a, int b) {
     return a > b ? a : b;
   }
   \endverbatim
 *
 * ...and in exactly one source file (in runtime/SPI), that is included in a
 * library...
 *
 * \verbatim
   #define INLINE
   #include "header.h"
   \endverbatim
 * 
 * This allows inlining, where possible, but when not possible, only one 
 * instance of the function is in storage (in the library).
