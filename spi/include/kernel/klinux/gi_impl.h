/**
 * \brief Get Global Barrier User Class Route Id
 *
 * Get the class route Id associated with a global barrier.  This class route...
 * - Is a global interrupt class route.
 * - Is a "user" class route for use by user mode applications.
 * - Includes all of the nodes in the job.
 * - Has an initialized global interrupt barrier associated with it.  This
 *   initialization takes place before the user mode application receives
 *   control.
 *
 * Usage Notes:
 * - Common usage is for a "master process" on each node to call this function
 *   to obtain this class route Id.
 * - The master process calls MUSPI_GIBarrierInit() to initialize software
 *   structures to use the barrier associated with that class route.  The
 *   kernel has previously called MUSPI_GIBarrierInitMU() to initialize the
 *   MU for the barrier.
 * - When processes on the node need to use the GIBarrier, they perform a
 *   local barrier first, then the master process enters the GIBarrier and polls
 *   for its completion, and finally, all processes perform the local barrier
 *   again.
 *
 * \param [out]  classRouteId  Pointer to a uint32_t where the Id of the user
 *                             global interrupt class route that includes all
 *                             nodes in the job is returned.
 *
 * \retval   0  Successful.
 * \retval   errno  Error.
