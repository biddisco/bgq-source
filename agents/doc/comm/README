This README contains information about the Comm Application Agent.

================================================================================

Overview

The Comm Agent is a program that runs on a thread on the 17th core of each node.
It is automatically started along with the application executable.  Its purpose
is to assist with communications (messaging) between nodes.  Specifically, the
Comm Agent performs the following functions:

1. Remote Get Pacing.  When messaging sends a large message to a far-away node,
it may choose to pass the message to the Comm Agent for pacing.  The Comm Agent
will break the message up into sub-messages and only allow a maximum number of
sub-messages to be in the network from this node at one time.  This paces the
amount of messaging traffic in the network, possibly reducing network congestion
which may improve performance.

2. One-sided Put Fence.  The Comm Agent is used during a fence operation to wait
for one-sided puts to complete.

The Comm Agent may be disabled (not started) by specifying environment variable
BG_APPAGENTCOMM=DISABLE.  If the application does not use messaging, this may be
specified to eliminate the Comm Agent's small memory footprint.  Even if the
application uses messaging, this may be specified.  In that case, the application
will continue to run with no remote get pacing.  However, if the application
performs a fence operation, it may fail with an assertion because the Comm Agent
is not running.

Default Configuration

The Comm Agent has parameters that may be controlled using environment variables.
Refer to the Application Development Guide for information about them.  The Comm
Agent's environment variables begin with "COMMAGENT_".
