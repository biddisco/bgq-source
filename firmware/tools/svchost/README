What's New in svc_host for BG/Q?

1) Many BG/P personality bits have been removed.  Thus many options and switches
   have also been removed.  An effort has been made to make this soft errors
   (warning message).  All .svchost files from the BG/P cvs repository have been
   run through the tool to validate this.

2) Personalization of CNK (including environment variables) has been removed.

3) svc_host expects bootloader images to be 64 bit.

4) Option & switch handling has been made into table-driven code and thus should
   be simpler to maintain as personality bits are added and removed.
